They go out of their way to help with organizing travel to and from the airport. Their consistently high level of service, competitive pricing, and reliability are the reasons I will continue to use them for trips to and from the airport and why I very strongly recommend Davidson Taxi Transfers.",

I will certainly use them in the future!",

    "I cant recomend Davidson Taxi Transfers enough. We contacted them last minute to arrange a pick up for our large party on return home from our holiday.

We enjoyed a friendly chat on the way which made the last part of our long journey fly in.Thanks again guys!!",

We would use them again, exclusively on our next trip.  A St Andrews friend referred me to them and I thanked him for such a good tip.",
    "Paul, from Davidson Taxis collected us from outside Edinburgh Waverley station in sleet and freezing temps last week. He arrived exactly when he said he would, quickly loaded our cases and got us to our destination before the weather worsened and the roads were closed the next day by snow. \r\nPaul was the most pleasant and interesting driver and his tales of his parrot\u2019s antics will remain with us all!! We needed something to lift our mood as we were travelling for a work event and the weather was closing in. Paul could easily have driven and said nothing, he would still have been a good taxi driver. As it was he lifted our spirits and we all agreed we wanted to use him for the return journey. His colleague who we booked with was great on the phone. The firm came highly recommended and now we know why. Thank you Paul, Jimmy and Derek!",
    "Great service----very helpful.",
    "We could not have hoped for a better and more patient driver than Paul. Paul was able to provide a child safety seat for a three-year-old passenger and ensured a friendly welcome despite the delayed flight. When the child got travel-sick, he was extremely kind and helpful. This was outstanding service both from and to Edinburgh airport.",

The process of organising the taxis was quick and efficient, all staff were very helpful throughout the whole process. The taxis arrived as planned on the evening of the event, and I was very impressed with the service that they provided to our guests. I would definitely use Davidson Taxi Transfers when organising future events, as they have been fantastic all the way through the process.",
    "I cannot tell you just how good this firm is. I rang on a Sunday evening to see if there was any way they could collect our daughter from Edinburgh airport to take her back to St Andrews. They went out of their way to provide a taxi, her plane was 30 mins late and they were able to accommodate that. The driver waited in arrivals inside rather than my daughter having to find him in the car park in the dark. It was an absolutely first class service. We\u2019d not used them before but certainly will from now on. On top of being really helpful they were also extremely friendly! Cannot recommend highly enough. \r\nPenny",
